in this code i have emplyed the logistic regression model for the given data set
I used this machine learning model because the item which was to be predicted was a binary variable as in this case was yes/no as we had to find out if income exceeded 50k
i also converted the categorical variables to numerical variables so that i can get a linear relation between them
this method is computationally efficent as compared to other more complex models like decision trees and neural networks
